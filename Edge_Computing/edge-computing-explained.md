# Edge Computing Explained

Edge computing is a computing paradigm that brings data processing and storage closer to where data is generated, rather than in a centralized location. This approach offers significant advantages in many real-world applications.

## Traditional Computing vs Edge Computing

### Traditional Computing Approach
1. Device captures data (e.g., smart doorbell recording video)
2. Data sent to cloud server (potentially thousands of miles away)
3. Server processes the data (e.g., video analysis for person detection)
4. Server sends results back to end user
5. Common issues: latency, high bandwidth usage, privacy concerns

### Edge Computing Approach
1. Device captures data locally
2. Processing happens at or near the device (the "edge")
3. Immediate local processing and response
4. Only relevant data sent to cloud if needed
5. Benefits: faster, more efficient, more private

## Real-World Applications

### Autonomous Vehicles
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Immediate decision-making required
