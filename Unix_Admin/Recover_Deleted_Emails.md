## Prerequisites

- A Time Machine backup from before the emails were deleted
- macOS with Apple Mail configured
- External drive with your Time Machine backup

&nbsp;

## Recovery Process

### 1. Disconnect from the Internet

Before starting any recovery process, disconnect your Mac from the internet (turn off Wi-Fi and unplug any Ethernet cables). This critical step prevents Apple Mail from syncing with Gmail's servers when opened.

### 2. Restore Mail Data from Time Machine

Instead of opening Mail directly, restore the Mail data files from Time Machine:

1. Connect your Time Machine backup drive
2. Open Finder
3. Hold down the Option key while clicking on the "Go" menu in the Finder toolbar
4. Select "Library" from the dropdown menu
5. Navigate to `Library → Mail` (you might see folders like V2, V5, V8, V10 depending on your macOS version)
6. Enter Time Machine by clicking the Time Machine icon in the menu bar
7. Navigate to a date before your emails were deleted
8. Select the entire Mail folder or the specific version folder (V2, V5, etc.)
9. Click "Restore"

### 3. Extract Emails Without Syncing

After restoring, don't open Apple Mail immediately:

1. In Finder, navigate to the restored `Library → Mail` folder
2. Look for `.emlx` files (these are individual email files)
3. You can search specifically for these files using Finder's search function with the term "*.emlx"
4. If you find files named "Filename.partial.emlx", you may need to rename them by removing the ".partial" part

### 4. Create a Backup of the Restored Emails

Before proceeding further:

1. Copy all the recovered email files to an external drive or create a compressed archive
2. Store this backup in a safe location in case anything goes wrong with subsequent steps

### 5. Create a New Local Mailbox

Now you can open Apple Mail while remaining offline:

1. Launch Apple Mail (while still disconnected from the internet)
2. Go to Mailbox → New Mailbox
3. In the location dropdown, select "On My Mac"
4. Name your new mailbox "Recovered Gmail" or something similar
5. Click "OK"

### 6. Import Emails to Local Storage

Rather than letting Mail sync with your Gmail account:

1. In Apple Mail, go to File → Import Mailboxes
2. Select "Files in mbox format" or "Apple Mail" option
3. Navigate to the location of your restored email files
4. Select the files and click "Continue"
5. Follow the prompts to import them to your new local "On My Mac" mailbox

### 7. Verify Recovery Before Reconnecting

1. Ensure your emails appear in the local mailbox you created
2. Check that the content and attachments are intact
3. Make sure email threading and metadata are preserved

### 8. Reconnect and Selectively Move Emails

Only after your emails are safely in local storage:

1. Reconnect to the internet
2. Selectively move important emails back to your Gmail account by dragging them to your Gmail folders
3. Be careful not to select "Move all messages now" if prompted, as this might trigger a full sync

### 9. Alternative: Set Up Gmail Again

If you need to reconfigure Gmail in Apple Mail:

1. Go to Mail → Preferences → Accounts
2. Select your Gmail account and click the (-) button to remove it
3. Click the (+) button to add it back
4. Follow the setup instructions

&nbsp;

## Troubleshooting

### If Mail Shows Empty Folders After Recovery

This may indicate that the recovered emails are in a different location than expected:

1. Search your Mac for ".emlx" files using Finder's search function
2. Check the Mail folder structure in `~/Library/Mail/` for alternative locations
3. Look for folders with long alphanumeric names that might contain your emails

### If Recovery Doesn't Work

Consider third-party recovery options:

1. Professional data recovery services
2. Mail backup solutions like Mail Backup X
3. If you have another device with your emails still intact, set it up for offline use

&nbsp;

## Prevention Tips for the Future

1. **Regular Exports**: Periodically export important emails to local storage
2. **Multiple Backups**: Maintain multiple Time Machine backups on different drives
3. **Use Email Backup Software**: Consider specialized tools for backing up emails
4. **Archive Instead of Delete**: Archive important emails rather than deleting them
