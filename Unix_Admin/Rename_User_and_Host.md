## Rename User ##

### Disable Auto-Login ###

(so you could log-in as root)

...

### Unlock the root Account ###

Set a password for your 'root' account -

```bash
sudo -i
...
passwd
... (password)
... (again)
```

### Switch User to root ###

Reboot, and log-in as 'root'

### Rename the User ###

```bash
usermod -l <newname> -d /home/<newname> -m <oldname>
```

### Rename the Group ###

(In single-user mode, it is named like the user)

```bash
groupmod -n <newgroup> <oldgroup>
```

### Optional: Change the User's Password ###

Change the password:

```bash
passwd
... (new password)
... (again)
```

### Fix Permissions in Home-Dir ###

(this may get trashed because you've connected as `root`)

```bash
sudo chown -R <newname>:<newname> /home/<newname>
```

### Confirm You can Log-In ###

Reboot and log-in as your new user

(**if it fails - re-login as `root` and fix whatever went wrong**)

### Optional: Lock the root Account ###

Re-connect as `root` and run this:

```bash
passwd -l root
```

## Rename Host ##

### Change the Hostname ###

Change the host-name to the new one:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

### Fix the Hosts-List ###

Change any occurrence of the old host-name to the new one:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

### Reboot - for the hostname ###

Reboot the host - for example:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Troubleshooting ##

### Error: Configured directory for incoming files does not exist ###

- Cause: The `Download` directory had moved
- Resolution:
  Log-in as `root`, then run
  ```
  su - <newname>
  sudo blueman-services &
  ```
  - Wait a few seconds for the dialog to pop
  - Choose **Transfer** and set an **Incoming Folder**
