## What is it good for

**virtualenv** is a tool that allows you to set an _isolated_ installation of Python,\
complete with the Python-executable and all the required modules.

To confirm everything is set as required, the setup can be run every time before using the environment -\
if all is already configured, it will just verify that and continue.

See **[virtualenv Lives!](https://hynek.me/articles/virtualenv-lives/)** where it says, among other things:

"Setting up Python to the point to be able install packages\
from PyPI can be annoying and time-intensive.\
Even worse are OS-provided installations that start throwing cryptic error messages.\
Especially desktops are prone to that but it’s possible to break the whole toolchain\
of a server by installing some shiny package you heard about on reddit."

## One-Time Effort

### Setup the Host

`virtualenv` should be pre-installed as root:

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Prepare a Requirements File

The requirements file should list all the packages to be installed in that virtual-env,\
as well as the specific version each should have, for example:\
requirements.txt

```bash
PyNaCl==1.2.0
PyYAML==3.12
```

- The list should reflect all required modules and their versions
- Make sure all modules are set to a specific version (with the `==` operator)

## Create and Use the Virtual-Env

### Choose a Name for the Virtual-Env

Set a folder-name (and location) for your virtual env

```bash
export VENV_DIR=<virtual-env-path-and-name>
```

### Create the Virtual-Env

```bash
virtualenv "${VENV_DIR}"
```

### Initialize the Virtual-Env

```bash
source "${VENV_DIR}/bin/activate"
```

### Install Required Python Packages on the Virtual-Env

```bash
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Exit the Virtual-Env

Case you would like to exit the virtualenv, run this:

```bash
deactivate
```
